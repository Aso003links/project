Every task, it is true, requires an essence of hard work and determination, but it also requires 
that it be placed on the right track to reach its goal, and huge credit for this goes to Dr. K. RAVI 
SHANKAR, M.Pharm., Ph.D., Principal, Aditya College of Pharmacy, Surampalem, under whose 
constant supervision and meticulous guidance this work was completed. With sincere thanks for his 
unwavering support, prompt counsel, collaboration, helpful suggestions, and provision of the greatest 
facilities during this project.
Thank you, sir, for showing me the means to raise my spirits and inspire me to believe in 
myself.
I owe a huge debt of gratitude to Associate Professor Dr. G.V.N. KIRANMAYI, M.Pharm. 
Ph.D., Department of Pharmacology, for which I am eternally grateful. Her helpful recommendations 
and strong attention throughout the project aided me tremendously in completing it.
I appreciate the prompt assistance and collaboration of the chemistry, analysis, and storage 
lab assistants during my project work.
I'd like to thank Librarian in particular for providing library services during my project work.
My sincere gratitude to SEKHAR sir, my Pharmaceutics lab assistant, for his assistance during the 
extraction process.
Special thanks to SWATHI madam, my pharmacology lab helper.
I would like to convey my heartfelt gratitude to Aditya College of Pharmacy in Surampalem. For 
providing me with all of the resources I need to complete this project successfully.
I owe a huge debt of gratitude to my Aditya College of Pharmacy Surampalem buddies for their 
unwavering support, unwavering encouragement, and helpful advice during my thesis work. Their 
amazing inputs simplified and logicalized my job. My mom and father have been incredibly 
supportive of me.

    INTRODUCTION

    Angiogenesis i.e., the formation of fresh blood vessels from pre-existing vessels is a fundamental 
component of tissue rebuilding related with healing of wound, tumor improvement, proliferative 
retinopathies, atherosclerosis and rheumatoid joint inflammation. Tumor angiogenesis is the result 
of an angiogenic irregularity in which proangiogenic factors prevail over antiangiogenic factors. 
Moreover, angiogenesis is fundamental for development and metastasis of most strong 
malignancies and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-A (VEGF-A) is accepted to be basic for 
tumor angiogenesis.
In spite of the importance of these in vivo tests, fundamental fiery responses can prompt 
obstructions that hamper their utilization for the investigation of angiogenesis guideline. In vitro 
culture of isolated endothelial cells is additionally helpful to examine the development of micro 
vessels, however the role of smooth muscle cells, pericytes and fibroblasts are not considered in 
these models. 
Anti-angiogenic drugs work by blocking the formation of fresh blood vessels by providing tumor 
cells with the necessary supplements and oxygen so as to delay the primary and metastatic tumor 
growth while conquering the inborn cytotoxicity of classical chemotherapies. 
In adults, with the exception of a couple of physiological cycles like menses, wound healing, and 
placental development, all angiogenic measures are pathologic. By obstructing the formation of 
fresh blood vessels, it helps to cut off the tumor's inventory of oxygen and supplements and, in 
this manner, its development and spread to different areas of the body. Now researchers are 
supporting that plant can be helpful in malignancies and at different levels also, with various 
mechanisms. Angiogenesis, metastasis, and tumor cell invasion have all been studied using 
chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) experiments (Lookman NA et al., 2012). In 1935, Hertig coined 
the term "angiogenesis," and in examining tumor angiogenesis, Folkman discovered the 
mechanism (Folkman J, 1972). The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) of a chick or duck embryo 
is an extraembryonic membrane that is knowingly utilized in vivo to research angiogenesis, antiangiogenesis, or both. Seventy-two to ninety-six hours (72–96 hr.) following stimulation, an 
angiogenic feedback or reaction occurs in the condition of increased vessel density around
